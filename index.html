				<p>Lembra daqueles livros onde os jovens bruxos brigam contra o Senhor das Trevas do Mal? Aquele filme onde os anões lutam para reconquistar a montanha deles de um dragão? Aquele desenho de TV sobre cavaleiros místicos e seu exército de clones que corrigem injustiças pela galáxia?</p>
				<p>Eles não são <i>incríveis?</i></p>
				<p>Aqui está sua chance de se colocar no lugar dos heróis de histórias como aquelas.</p>
				<p><i>Aventuras de Outro Mundo</i> é um RPG de mesa, onde você e seus amigos se reúnem e contam histórias cheias de perigos, agitação e aventuras. Você talvez tenha jogado jogos parecidos com esse antes, —<i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> é um bem popular, mas não se preocupe se não tiver; esse livreto te guiará.</p>
				<p>Aqui está o que você precisa para jogar:</p>
				<section class="my-6">
					<div class="columns is-vcentered">

Você pode encontrar esses dados em muitas lojas de jogos, geralmente com seu nome original—dado Fudge. Nós os chamamos de Dados Fate nesse livro, mas você pode chamá-los como preferir. A Evil Hat ofertará Dados Fate em <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/">www.evilhat.com</a> no final de 2013.</li>
								<li><b>De três a cinco pessoas</b>. Um de vocês será o <b>Mestre</b>, os outros serão <b>jogadores</b>. Nós discutiremos sobre o que isso significa mais para frente.</li>
								<li>O <b>Baralho de Fate</b> é uma alternativa aos Dados Fate. É um baralho de cartas que simula a probabilidade do Dado Fate, e é projetado para ser usado do mesmo jeito que os dados são. O Baralho de Fate estará disponível na Evil Hat em 2013 ou 2014.</li>

				<h1 class="title is-size-1 is-uppercase">Telling Stories Together</h1>
				<p>So you’ve gathered your friends, your dice, and your index cards, and you’re ready to play <i>Aventuras de Outro Mundo</i> (we’ll call it <i>AAW</i> from now on). Time to tell some stories!</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">What Do You Mean, “Tell Stories”?</h2>
				<p><i>AAW</i> is all about telling stories. You create a group of characters and follow them through some imaginary adventure that you all take turns telling little parts of.</p>
				<p>Think about a movie, video game, or TV show you like where the characters go on adventures—something like <i>The Legend of Korra</i> or <i>Star Wars</i> or <i>The Avengers</i> or the <i>Zelda games</i> or <i>Doctor Who</i> or <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Now imagine a similar sort of story, where you and your friends around the table make the decisions for the characters as they move through the story, and the story changes as you make those decisions.</p>
				<p>Sometimes someone makes a decision to try something and you don’t know for sure how it would turn out; that’s when you roll dice to see what happens next. The higher you roll, the better the chance that things work out the way you want them to.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">So How Do We Do It?</h2>
				<p>Well, first you need to figure out what kind of story you’re going to tell. What genre are you interested in? Fantasy? Science fiction? Modern-day adventure? Will you play in the world of a TV show or comic book or movie that you love, or will you create your own world? For some great advice about how to design the framework of your game, see <i>Game Creation in Fate Core</i>, available for free at <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/">www.evilhat.com</a>.</p>
				<p>Next, it’s time to choose who will be the players, and who will be the gamemaster. Of the people around the table, all but one are referred to as <b>players</b>. Each player takes on the role of one <b>player character</b> or <b>PC</b> in the story, and puts themselves in their character’s shoes to make the decisions that their character would make. The remaining person is called the <b>gamemaster</b> or <b>GM</b>. The GM’s job is to present challenges to the players and to portray all the characters that aren’t controlled by the players (<b>non-player characters</b> or <b>NPCs</b>).</p>
				<p>Once you decide who the GM will be, and what the genre and framework of the story will be, it’s time for the players to make their characters—that’s in the next chapter.</p>
				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Telling Stories “Together”? What Do You Mean?</h3>
				<p>All the people at the table, GM and players alike, are responsible for telling the story. When you make a decision for your character (or for one of the NPCs, if you’re the GM), think about two things.</p>
				<p>First, put yourself in your character’s shoes and think hard about what they would do—even if it’s not the best idea. If you’re playing a character that sometimes makes poor decisions, don’t be afraid to make a poor decision for them on purpose.</p>
				<p>Second—and this is really important—think about the story that’s being told. Think about the choice that would make that story even better: more interesting, more exciting, funnier. Would a certain choice give another player’s character a chance to be awesome? Strongly consider making that choice.</p>
				<p>That’s how you tell great stories <i>together</i>—by not being afraid for your character to make mistakes, and by making choices that make the story more interesting for everyone at the table—not just you.</p>

				<h1 class="title is-size-1 is-uppercase">Quem Você Quer Ser?</h1>
				<p>Uma vez decidido que tipo de história você contará no seu jogo, você decide quem é seu personagem — como ele se parece, no que é bom, e no que acredita.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Que Tipo de Personagens Eu Posso Ser?</h2>
				<p>Pense no cenário no qual decidiu jogar e faça disso seu principal guia. Está jogando em uma escola para jovens feiticeiros? Seja um jovem feiticeiro! Pilotos espaciais lutando contra um império maligno? Seja um piloto espacial! Tenha certeza de que seu personagem tem um motivo para interagir e cooperar com os personagens que os outros jogadores estão criando.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Como Eu Faço Um Personagem?</h2>
				<p>Agora é hora de colocar tudo no papel. Pegue um lápis e uma cópia da ficha de personagem. Algumas pessoas gostam de usar PDFs preenchíveis em um notebook ou computador de mesa. Qualquer um desses está ótimo, mas você com certeza quer algo que te permita apagar e alterar.</p>
				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Aspectos em Poucas Palavras</h3>
				<p>Um <b>aspecto</b> é uma palavra, frase, ou sentença que descreve algo centralmente importante para o seu personagem. Pode ser o lema pelo qual seu personagem vive, uma personalidade peculiar, a descrição de um relacionamento que você tem com outro personagem, uma posse importante ou pedaço de equipamento que seu personagem tem, ou qualquer outra parte do seu personagem que seja de vital importância.</p>
				<p>Aspectos te permitem mudar a história de maneiras que encaixem com as tendências, habilidades ou problemas de seu personagem. Você também pode usá-los para estabelecer fatos sobre o cenário, como a presença de magia ou a existência de um útil aliado, perigoso inimigo, ou uma organização secreta.</p>
				<p>Seu personagem terá um punhado de aspectos (entre três e cinco), incluindo uma <b>particularidade</b> e um <b>problema</b>. Discutiremos detalhadamente os aspectos em <i>Aspectos e Pontos de Destino</i>—mas por enquanto, isso deve te ajudar a ter uma ideia.</p>
<section class="my-6">			
				<div class="box">
					<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Particularidade
						<p>
							<p>Primeiro, decida a <b>particularidade</b> do seu personagem. Sendo uma única frase ou sentença que o defina objetivamente, dizendo quem você é, o que faz, qual é “a tua”. Quando pensar na sua particularidade, tente pensar em duas coisas: como esse aspecto poderia te ajudar, e como poderia dificultar as coisas para você. Boas particularidades fazem ambos.</p>
							<p class="has-text-centered is-italic">Por exemplo: Capitão Felino da Embarcação Cirrus; Invocador Solar do Deserto de Andral; Chefe dos Agentes de Campo da IGEMA</p>
							<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Problema</p>
							<p>Em seguida, escolha a coisa que sempre te coloca em <b>perigo</b>. Pode ser uma fraqueza pessoal, um inimigo recorrente, ou um dever importante — qualquer coisa que deixe sua vida mais complicada.</p>
							<p class="has-text-centered is-italic">Exemplos: Os Assassinos do Aço Me Querem Morto; Atire Magias Primeiro, Pergunte Depois; Tenho Que Cuidar do Meu Irmãozinho</p>
							<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Outro Aspecto</p>
							<p>Agora componha outro aspecto. Pense em algo realmente importante ou interessante sobre seu personagem. É a pessoa mais forte da sua cidade natal? Carrega uma poderosa e renomada espada? Fala demais? É podre de rico?</p>
							<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Opcional: Um ou Dois Aspectos Adicionais</p>
							<p>Se desejar, você pode criar um ou dois aspectos a mais. Esses aspectos podem descrever o relacionamento com o personagem de outro jogador ou com um PNJ. Ou, como o terceiro aspecto composto acima, pode descrever algo especialmente interessante sobre o seu personagem.</p>
							<p>Se você preferir, pode deixar um ou ambos em branco agora e preenchê-los depois, assim que o jogo tiver começado.</p>
							<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Nome e Aparência</p>
							<p>Descreva a aparência do seu personagem e lhe dê um nome.</p>
							<figure class="image is-full-width"> <img src="img/startling-51.png" alt="Startling Comics #51, art by Alex Schomburg https://digitalcomicmuseum.com/index.php?dlid=27123"> </figure>

						<ul>
							<li>Escreva dois aspectos: uma particularidade e um problema.</li>
							<li>Escreva outro aspecto.</li>
							<li>Dê um nome e descreva a aparência do seu personagem.</li>
							<li>Escolha abordagens.</li>

					<div class="column is-7 is-primary">
						<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Abordagens</h3>
						<p>Escolha suas <b>abordagens</b>.</p>
						<p>Abordagens são descrições de como você deseja concluir as tarefas. Todos possuem as mesmas seis abordagens:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Cauteloso</li>
							<li>Esperto</li>
							<li>Chamativo</li>
							<li>Enérgico</li>
							<li>Rápido</li>
							<li>Sorrateiro</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Cada abordagem é avaliada com um bônus. Escolha uma como Boa (+3), duas como Razoável (+2), duas como Mediana (+1), e uma como Medíocre (+0). Você poderá melhora-las posteriormente. Falaremos sobre o quê cada abordagem significa e como você as usará em <i>Como Fazer Coisas: Resultados, Abordagens, e Ações</i>.</p>
						<p>Suas abordagens podem dizer muito sobre quem você é. Aqui estão alguns exemplos:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>O Brutamontes:</b> Enérgico +3, Cauteloso e Chamativo +2, Sorrateiro e Rápido +1, Esperto +0</li>
							<li><b>A Estrela:</b> Rápido +3, Enérgico e Chamativo +2, Esperto e Cauteloso +1, Sorrateiro +0</li>
							<li><b>O Trapaceiro:</b> Esperto +3, Sorrateiro e Chamativo +2, Enérgico e Rápido +1, Cauteloso +0</li>
							<li><b>O Guardião:</b> Cauteloso +3, Enérgico e Esperto +2, Sorrateiro e Rápido +1, Chamativo +0</li>
							<li><b>A Ladra:</b> Sorrateiro +3, Cauteloso e Rápido +2, Esperto e Chamativo +1, Enérgico +0</li>
							<li><b>O Mosqueteiro:</b> Chamativo +3, Rápido e Esperto +2, Enérgico e Sorrateiro +1, Cauteloso +0</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="column is-1 is-primary"></div>
					<div class="column is-primary is-3">
						<div class="box">
							<h3 class="is-size-5">A ESCADA</h3>
							<p>Em <i>AOM</i>, nós usamos uma escada de adjetivos e numero para avaliar as abordagens de um personagem, o resultado de uma rolagem, classificação de dificuldades para checagens simples, etc.</p>
							<p>Aqui está a escada:</p>
							<table class="is-size-7 table is-narrow table is-striped">

					<div class="columns is-8">
						<div class="column is-half">
							<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Manobras e Vigor</h3>
							<p>Uma <b>manobra</b> é uma característica especial que muda o modo como uma abordagem funciona para o seu personagem. Geralmente, manobras te dão um bônus (quase sempre +2) para uma determinada abordagem quando utilizada com uma ação em particular sob circunstâncias específicas. Falaremos mais sobre manobras em <i>Manobras</i>. Escolha uma manobra para começar, ou você pode esperar e adicionar uma manobra durante o jogo. Mais tarde, quando seu personagem evoluir, você pode escolher mais.</p>
							<p>Seu <b>vigor</b> é o número de pontos de destino com os quais você começa cada sessão de jogo—a menos que você tenha terminado a sessão anterior gastando mais pontos de destino do que seu vigor total, nesse caso você continuará com o número que tinha anteriormente. Por padrão, seu vigor começa em três e é reduzido em um para cada manobra após as primeiras três que você escolheu — essencialmente, suas primeiras três manobras são de graça! Conforme o seu personagem evolui, você terá oportunidades de aumentar o seu vigor. Seu vigor nunca pode ser reduzido a menos do que um.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="column">
							<div class="box has-background-grey-darker has-text-white">
								<p class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold">QUANTAS MANOBRAS?</p>
								<p>Por padrão, <i>AOM</i> sugere escolher uma manobra para começar.</p>
								<p>No entanto, se essa é a sua primeira vez jogando um jogo Fate, você talvez ache mais fácil de escolher sua primeira manobra depois de ter tido a chance de jogar um pouco, para ter uma ideia de como pode ser uma boa manobra. Apenas adicione a sua manobra à sua ficha durante ou depois da sua primeira sessão de jogo.</p>
								<p>Por outro lado, se você é um experiente jogador de Fate, você pode se planejar e descobrir que, assim como em Fate Core, seu personagem tem direito a três manobras grátis antes de começar a usar o seu vigor. Nesse caso, deixe o membro do seu grupo com menos experiência ser o seu guia; se alguém é novo no jogo e só pega uma manobra para começar, então é isso que todos deveriam fazer. Se todos vocês já possuírem experiência, e quiserem começar com personagens mais poderosos, então peguem três manobras e partiu.</p>

				<p>Now it’s time to start doing something. You need to leap from one moving train car to another. You need to search the entire library for that spell you really need. You need to distract the guard so you can sneak into the fortress. How do you figure out what happens?</p>

							<p>First you narrate what your character is trying to do. Your character’s own aspects provide a good guide for what you <i>can</i> do. If you have an aspect that suggests you can perform magic, then cast that spell. If your aspects describe you as a swordsman, draw that blade and have at it. These story details don’t have additional mechanical impact. You don’t get a bonus from your magic or your sword, unless you choose to spend a fate point to <b>invoke</b> an appropriate aspect. Often, the ability to use an aspect to make something true in the story is bonus enough!</p>
							<p>How do you know if you’re successful? Often, you just succeed, because the action isn’t hard and nobody’s trying to stop you. But if failure provides an interesting twist in the story, or if something unpredictable could happen, you need to break out the dice.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</section>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Dice or Cards</h2>
				<p>Part of determining your outcome is generating a random number, which is usually done in one of two ways: rolling four Fate Dice, or drawing a card from a Deck of Fate.</p>
				<p><b>Fate Dice:</b> Fate Dice (sometimes called Fudge dice, after the game they were originally designed for) are one way to determine outcomes. You always roll Fate Dice in a set of four. Each die will come up as <b class="has-background-success has-text-white">&nbsp;+&nbsp;</b>, <b class="has-background-warning has-text-warning">&nbsp;0&nbsp;</b>, or <b class="has-background-danger has-text-white">&nbsp;-&nbsp;</b>, and you add them together to get the total of the roll.</p>

						<div class="column"> <b class="has-background-danger has-text-white">&nbsp;-&nbsp;</b>, <b class="has-background-success has-text-white">&nbsp;+&nbsp;</b>, <b class="has-background-warning has-text-warning">&nbsp;0&nbsp;</b>, <b class="has-background-success has-text-white">&nbsp;+&nbsp;</b> = +1 </div>
						<div class="column"> <b class="has-background-success has-text-white">&nbsp;+&nbsp;</b>, <b class="has-background-danger has-text-white">&nbsp;-&nbsp;</b>, <b class="has-background-warning has-text-warning">&nbsp;0&nbsp;</b>, <b class="has-background-warning has-text-warning">&nbsp;0&nbsp;</b> = 0 </div>

					</div>

				<p>Deck of Fate: The Deck of Fate is a deck of cards that copies the statistical spread of Fate Dice. You can choose to use them instead of dice—either one works great.</p>
				<p>These rules are written with the assumption that you’re rolling Fate Dice, but use whichever one your group prefers. Anytime you’re told to roll dice, that also means you can draw from the Deck of Fate instead.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Outcomes</h2>
				<p>Once you roll your dice, add your approach bonus (we’ll talk about that in a moment) and any bonuses from aspects or stunts. Compare the total to a target number, which is either a fixed difficulty or the result of the GM’s roll for an NPC. Based on that comparison, your outcome is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You <b>fail</b> if your total is less than your opponent’s total.</li>
					<li>It’s a <b>tie</b> if your total is equal to your opponent’s total.</li>
					<li>You <b>succeed</b> if your total is greater than your opponent’s total.</li>
					<li>You <b>succeed with style</b> if your total is at least three greater than your opponent’s total.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Now that we’ve covered outcomes, we can talk about actions and how the outcomes work with them.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Actions</h2>
				<p>So you’ve narrated what your PC is trying to do, and you’ve established that there’s a chance you could fail. Next, figure out what <b>action</b> best describes what you’re trying to do. There are four basic actions that cover anything you do in the game.</p>
				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Create an Advantage</h3>
				<p><b>Creating an advantage</b> is anything you do to try to help yourself or one of your friends. Taking a moment to very carefully aim your proton blaster, spending several hours doing research in the school library, or tripping the thug who’s trying to rob you—these all count as creating an advantage. The target of your action may get a chance to use the defend action to stop you. The advantage you create lets you do one of the following three things:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a new situation aspect. </li>
					<li>Discover an existing situation aspect or another character’s aspect that you didn’t know about. </li>
					<li>Take advantage of an existing aspect. </li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>If you’re creating a new aspect or discovering an existing one:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>If you fail:</b> Either you don’t create or discover the aspect at all, or you create or discover it but an <i>opponent</i> gets to invoke the aspect for free. The second option works best if the aspect you create or discover is something that other people could take advantage of (like <b><i>Rough Terrain</i></b>). You may have to reword the aspect to show that it benefits the other character instead of you—work it out in whatever way makes the most sense with the player who gets the free invocation. You can still invoke the aspect if you’d like, but it’ll cost you a fate point.</li>
					<li> <b>If you tie:</b> If you’re creating a new aspect, you get a <b>boost</b>. Name it and invoke it once for free—after that, the boost goes away. If you’re trying to discover an existing aspect, treat this as a success (see below). </li>
					<li><b>If you succeed:</b> You create or discover the aspect, and you or an ally may invoke it once for free. Write the aspect on an index card or sticky note and place it on the table.</li>
					<li><b>If you succeed with style:</b> You create or discover the aspect, and you or an ally may invoke it <i>twice</i> for free. Usually you can’t invoke the same aspect twice on the same roll, but this is an exception; success with style gives you a BIG advantage!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you’re trying to take advantage of an aspect you already know about:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>If you fail:</b> You don’t get any additional benefit from the aspect. You can still invoke it in the future if you’d like, at the cost of a fate point.</li>
					<li><b>If you tie or succeed:</b> You get one free invocation on the aspect for you or an ally to use later. You might want to draw a circle or a box on the aspect’s note card, and check it off when that invocation is used.</li>
					<li><b>If you succeed with style:</b> You get <i>two</i> free invocations on the aspect, which you can let an ally use, if you wish.</li>
				</ul>

			<section class="section">
				<div class="container is-max-desktop">
					<div class="content">
						<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Overcome</h3>
						<p>You use the <b>overcome</b> action when you have to get past something that’s between you and a particular goal—picking a lock, escaping from handcuffs, leaping across a chasm, flying a spaceship through an asteroid field. Taking some action to eliminate or change an inconvenient situation aspect is usually an overcome action; we’ll talk more about that in <i>Aspects</i> and Fate Points. The target of your action may get a chance to use the defend action to stop you.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>If you fail:</b> You have a tough choice to make. You can simply fail—the door is still locked, the thug still stands between you and the exit, the enemy spaceship is still <b class="is-italic">On Your Tail</b>. Or you can succeed, but at a serious cost—maybe you drop something vital you were carrying, maybe you suffer harm. The GM helps you figure out an appropriate cost.</li>
							<li><b>If you tie:</b> You attain your goal, but at some minor cost. The GM could introduce a complication, or present you with a tough choice (you can rescue one of your friends, but not the other), or some other twist. See “<i>Succeed at a Cost</i>” in <i>Running the Game</i> in <i>Fate Core</i> for more ideas.</li>
							<li><b>If you succeed:</b> You accomplish what you were trying to do. The lock springs open, you duck around the thug blocking the door, you manage to lose the alien spaceship on your tail.</li>
							<li><b>If you succeed with style:</b> As success (above), but you also gain a boost.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Attack</h3>
						<p>Use an <b>attack</b> when you try to hurt someone, whether physically or mentally—swinging a sword, shooting a blaster rifle, or yelling a blistering insult with the intent to hurt your target. (We’ll talk about this in <i>Ouch! Damage, Stress, and Consequences</i>, but the important thing is: If someone gets hurt too badly, they’re knocked out of the scene.) The target of your attack gets a chance to use the defend action to stop you.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>If you fail:</b> Your attack doesn’t connect. The target parries your sword, your shot misses, your target laughs off your insult.</li>
							<li><b>If you tie:</b> Your attack doesn’t connect strongly enough to cause any harm, but you gain a boost.</li>
							<li><b>If you succeed:</b> Your attack hits and you do damage. See <i>Ouch! Damage, Stress, and Consequences</i>. </li>
							<li><b>If you succeed with style:</b> You hit and do damage, plus you have the option to reduce the damage your hit causes by one and gain a boost. </li>
						</ul>
						<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Defend</h3>
						<p>Use <b>defend</b> when you’re actively trying to stop someone from doing any of the other three actions—you’re parrying a sword strike, trying to stay on your feet, blocking a doorway, and the like. Usually this action is performed on <i>someone else’s turn</i>, reacting to their attempt to attack, overcome, or create an advantage. You may also roll to oppose some non-attack actions, or to defend against an attack on someone else, if you can explain why you can. Usually it’s fine if most people at the table agree that it’s reasonable, but you can also point to an relevant situation aspect to justify it. When you do, you become the target for any bad results.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>If you fail:</b> You’re on the receiving end of whatever your opponent’s success gives them.</li>
							<li><b>If you tie or succeed:</b> Things don’t work out too badly for you; look at the description of your opponent’s action to see what happens.</li>
							<li><b>If you succeed with style:</b> Your opponent doesn’t get what they want, plus you gain a boost.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Getting Help</h3>
						<p>An ally can help you perform your action. When an ally helps you, they give up their action for the exchange and describe how they’re providing the help; you get a +1 to your roll for each ally that helps this way. Usually only one or two people can help this way before they start getting in each other’s way; the GM decides how many people can help at once.</p>
						<div class="container my-6">
							<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Choose Your Approach</h2>
							<p>As we mentioned in <i>Who Do You Want to Be?</i>, there are six <b>approaches</b> that describe how you perform actions.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Careful:</b> A Careful action is when you pay close attention to detail and take your time to do the job right. Lining up a long-range arrow shot. Attentively standing watch. Disarming a bank’s alarm system.</li>
								<li><b>Clever:</b> A Clever action requires that you think fast, solve problems, or account for complex variables. Finding the weakness in an enemy swordsman’s style. Finding the weak point in a fortress wall. Fixing a computer.</li>
								<li><b>Flashy:</b> A Flashy action draws attention to you; it’s full of style and panache. Delivering an inspiring speech to your army. Embarrassing your opponent in a duel. Producing a magical fireworks display.</li>
								<li><b>Forceful:</b> A Forceful action isn’t subtle—it’s brute strength. Wrestling a bear. Staring down a thug. Casting a big, powerful magic spell.</li>
								<li><b>Quick:</b> A Quick action requires that you move quickly and with dexterity. Dodging an arrow. Getting in the first punch. Disarming a bomb as it ticks 3… 2… 1…</li>
								<li><b>Sneaky:</b> A Sneaky action is done with an emphasis on misdirection, stealth, or deceit. Talking your way out of getting arrested. Picking a pocket. Feinting in a sword fight.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p>Each character has each approach rated with a bonus from +0 to +3. Add the bonus to your dice roll to determine how well your PC performs the action you described.</p>
						<p>So your first instinct is probably to pick the action that gives you the greatest bonus, right? But it doesn’t work like that. You have to base your choice of approach on the description of your action, and you can’t describe an action that doesn’t make any sense. Would you Forcefully creep through a dark room, hiding from the guards? No, that’s being Sneaky. Would you Quickly push that big rock out of the way of the wagon? No, that’s being Forceful. Circumstances constrain what approach you can use, so sometimes you have to go with an approach that might not play directly to your strengths.</p>
						<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Roll the Dice, Add Your Bonus</h2>
						<p>Time to take up dice and roll. Take the bonus associated with the approach you’ve chosen and add it to the result on the dice. If you have a stunt that applies, add that too. That’s your total. Compare it to what your opponent (usually the GM) has.</p>
						<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Decide Whether to Modify the Roll</h2>
						<p>Finally, decide whether you want to alter your roll by invoking aspects—we’ll talk about this a lot in <i>Aspects and Fate Points</i>.</p>

	<!--Challenges, Contests, and Conflicts-->
	<section class="section">
		<div class="container is-max-desktop">
			<div class="content">
				<h1 class="title is-size-1 is-uppercase">Challenges, Contests, and Conflicts</h1>
				<p>We’ve talked about the four actions (create an advantage, overcome, attack, and defend) and the four outcomes (fail, tie, succeed, and succeed with style). But in what framework do those happen?</p>
				<p>Usually, when you want to do something straightforward—swim across a raging river, hack someone’s cell phone—all you need to do is make one overcome action against a difficulty level that the GM sets. You look at your outcome and go from there.</p>
				<p>But sometimes things are a little more complex.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Challenges</h2>
				<p>A <b>challenge</b> is a series of overcome and create an advantage actions that you use to resolve an especially complicated situation. Each overcome action deals with one task or part of the situation, and you take the individual results together to figure out how the situation resolves.</p>
				<p>To set up a challenge, decide what individual tasks or goals make up the situation, and treat each one as a separate overcome roll.</p>
				<p>Depending on the situation, one character may be required to make several rolls, or multiple characters may be able to participate. GMs, you aren’t obligated to announce all the stages in the challenge ahead of time—adjust the steps as the challenge unfolds to keep things exciting.</p>
				<p class="box is-italic">The PCs are the crew of a ship caught in a storm. They decide to press on and try to get to their destination despite the weather, and the GM suggests this sounds like a challenge. Steps in resolving this challenge could be calming panicky passengers, repairing damaged rigging, and keeping the ship on the right heading.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Contests</h2>
				<p>When two or more characters are competing against one another for the same goal, but not directly trying to hurt each other, you have a <b>contest</b>. Examples include a car chase, a public debate, or an archery tournament.</p>
				<p>A contest proceeds in a series of exchanges. In an exchange, every participant takes one overcome action to determine how well they do in that leg of the contest. Compare your result to everyone else’s.</p>
				<p>If you got the highest result, you win the exchange—you score a victory (which you can represent with a tally or check mark on scratch paper) and describe how you take the lead. If you succeed with style, you mark two victories.</p>
				<p>If there’s a tie, no one gets a victory, and an unexpected twist occurs. This could mean several things, depending on the situation—the terrain or environment shifts somehow, the parameters of the contest change, or an unanticipated variable shows up and affects all the participants. The GM creates a new situation aspect reflecting this change and puts it into play.</p>
				<p>The first participant to achieve three victories wins the contest.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Conflicts</h2>
				<p><b>Conflicts</b> are used to resolve situations where characters are trying to harm one another. It could be physical harm (a sword fight, a wizard’s duel, a battle with laser blasters), but it could also be mental harm (a shouting match, a tough interrogation, a magical psychic assault).</p>
				
<section class="my-6">
				<div class="columns is-8">
					<div class="column is-two-thirds">
						<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Setting the Scene</h3>
						<p>Establish what’s going on, where everyone is, and what the environment is like. Who is the opposition? The GM should write a couple of situation aspects on sticky notes or index cards and place them on the table. Players can suggest situation aspects, too.</p>
						<p>The GM also establishes zones, loosely defined areas that tell you where characters are. You determine zones based on the scene and the following guidelines:</p>
						<p>Generally, you can interact with other characters in the same zone—or in nearby zones if you can justify acting at a distance (for example, if you have a ranged weapon or magic spell).</p>
						<p>You can move one zone for free. An action is required to move if there’s an obstacle along the way, such as someone trying to stop you, or if you want to move two or more zones. It sometimes helps to sketch a quick map to illustrate zones.</p>

								<li>Set the scene.</li>
								<li>Determine turn order.</li>
								<li>Start the first exchange.</li>
								<li>On your turn, take an action.</li>
								<li>On other people’s turns, defend against or respond to their actions as necessary.</li>
								<li>At the end of everyone’s turn, start a new exchange or end the conflict.</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="box is-italic">Thugs are attacking the characters in a house. The living room is one zone, the kitchen another, the front porch another, and the yard a fourth. Anyone in the same zone can easily throw punches at each other. From the living room, you can throw things at people in the kitchen or move into the kitchen as a free action, unless the doorway is blocked. To get from the living room to the front porch or yard requires an action.</p>
</section>

				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Determine Turn Order</h3>
				<p>Your turn order in a conflict is based on your approaches. In a physical conflict, compare your Quick approach to the other participants’—the one with the fastest reflexes goes first. In a mental conflict, compare your Careful approach—attention to detail will warn you of danger. Whoever has the highest approach gets to go first, and then everyone else goes in descending order. Break ties in whatever manner makes sense, with the GM having the last word.</p>
				<p>GMs, it’s simplest if you pick your most advantageous NPC to determine your place in the turn order, and let all your NPCs go at that time. But if you have a good reason to determine turn order individually for all your NPCs, go right ahead.</p>
				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Exchanges</h3>
				<p>Next, each character takes a turn in order. On their turn, a character can take one of the four actions. Resolve the action to determine the outcome. The conflict is over when only one side has characters still in the fight.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<h1 class="title is-size-1 is-uppercase">Ouch! Damage, Stress, and Consequences</h1>
				<p>When you’re hit by an attack, the severity of the hit is the difference between the attack roll and your defense roll; we measure that in <b>shifts</b>. For instance, if your opponent gets +5 on their attack and you get a +3 on your defense, the attack deals a two shift hit (5 – 3 = 2).</p>
				<p>Then, one of two things happens:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You suffer <b>stress and/or consequences</b>, but you stay in the fight.</li>
					<li>You get taken out, which means you’re out of the action for a while.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mb-6">
					<div class="columns is-gapless">
						<div class="column is-primary">
							<div class="box has-background-grey-darker has-text-white">
								<p class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold mb-6">STRESS & CONSEQUENCES: THE 30-SECOND VERSION</p>
								<p class="mb-4">
									<ul>
										<li>Each character starts with three stress boxes.</li>
										<li>Severity of hit (in shifts)</li>
										<li>= Attack Roll – Defense Roll</li>
										<li>When you take a hit, you need to account for how that hit damages you. One way to absorb the damage is to take stress; you can check one stress box to handle some or all of a single hit. You can absorb a number of shifts equal to the number of the box you check: one for Box 1, two for Box 2, three for Box 3.</li>
										<li>You may also take one or more consequences to deal with the hit, by marking off one or more consequence slots and writing a new aspect for each one. Mild consequence = 2 shifts; moderate = 4 shifts; severe = 6 shifts.</li>
										<li>If you can’t (or decide not to) handle the entire hit, you’re taken out. Your opponent decides what happens to you.</li>
										<li>Giving in before your opponent’s roll allows you to control how you exit the scene. You also get one or more fate points for doing this!</li>
										<li>Stress and mild consequences vanish at the end of the scene, provided you get a chance to rest. Other consequences take longer.</li>
									</ul>

						<div class="column is-hidden-touch" style="background: url('img/hawk-17.png') no-repeat left center; background-size: contain;" aria-label="Blackhawk #017 Art by: Al Bryant https://digitalcomicmuseum.com/index.php?dlid=20575"> </div>
					</div>
					<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">What Is Stress?</h2>
					<p>If you get hit and don’t want to be taken out, you can choose to take stress.</p>
					<p>Stress represents you getting tired or annoyed, taking a superficial wound, or some other condition that goes away quickly.</p>
					<p>Your character sheet has a <b>stress track</b>, a row of three boxes. When you take a hit and check a stress box, the box absorbs a number of shifts equal to its number: one shift for Box 1, two for Box 2, or three for Box 3.</p>
					<p>You can only check one stress box for any single hit, but you can check a stress box and take one or more consequences at the same time. You can’t check a stress box that already has a check mark in it!</p>
					<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">What Are Consequences?</h2>
					<p>Consequences are new aspects that you take to reflect being seriously hurt in some way. Your character sheet has three slots where you can write consequences. Each one is labeled with a number: 2 (mild consequence), 4 (moderate consequence), or 6 (severe consequence). This represents the number of shifts of the hit the consequence absorbs. You can mark off as many of these as you like to handle a single hit, but only if that slot was blank to start with. If you already have a moderate consequence written down, you can’t take another one until you do something to make the first one go away!</p>
					<p>A major downside of consequences is that each consequence is a new aspect that your opponents can invoke against you. The more you take, the more vulnerable you are. And just like situation aspects, the character that creates it (in this case, the character that hit you) gets one free invocation on that consequence. They can choose to let one of their allies use the free invocation.</p>
					<p class="box is-italic">Let’s say that you get hit really hard and take a 4-shift hit. You check Box 2 on your stress track, which leaves you with 2 shifts to deal with. If you can’t, you’re taken out, so it’s time for a consequence. You can choose to write a new aspect in the consequence slot labeled 2—say, <b>Sprained Ankle</b>. Those final 2 shifts are taken care of and you can keep fighting!</p>
					<p>If you’re unable to absorb all of a hit’s shifts—by checking a stress box, taking consequences, or both—you’re taken out.</p>
					<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">What Happens When I Get Taken Out?</h2>
					<p>If you get taken out, you can no longer act in the scene. Whoever takes you out narrates what happens to you. It should make sense based on how you got taken out—maybe you run from the room in shame, or maybe you get knocked unconscious.</p>
					<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Giving In</h2>
					<p>If things look grim for you, you can <b>give in</b> (or <b>concede</b> the fight)—but you have to say that’s what you’re going to do before your opponent rolls their dice.</p>
					<p>This is different than being taken out, because you get a say in what happens to you. Your opponent gets some major concession from you—talk about what makes sense in your situation—but it beats getting taken out and having no say at all.</p>
					<p>Additionally, you get one fate point for conceding, and one fate point for each consequence you took in this conflict. This is your chance to say, “You win this round, but I’ll get you next time!” and get a tall stack of fate points to back it up.</p>
					<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Getting Better—Recovering from Stress and Consequences</h2>
					<p>At the end of each scene, clear all of your stress boxes. Recovery from a consequence is a bit more complicated; you need to explain how you recover from it—whether that’s an ER visit, taking a walk to calm down, or whatever makes sense with the consequence. You also need to wait an appropriate length of time.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Mild consequence:</b> Clear it at the end of the scene, provided you get a chance to rest.</li>
						<li><b>Moderate consequence:</b> Clear it at the end of the next session, provided it makes sense within the story.</li>
						<li><b>Severe consequence:</b> Clear it at the end of the scenario, provided it makes sense within the story. </li>
					</ul>
					<div class="box has-background-grey-darker has-text-white">
						<p class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold is-uppercase">RENAMING MODERATE AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES</p>
						<p>Moderate and severe consequences stick around for a while. Therefore, at some point you may want to change the name of the aspect to better fit what’s going on in the story. For instance, after you get some medical help, Painful Broken Leg might make more sense if you change it to Hobbling on Crutches.</p>

				<h1 class="title is-size-1 is-uppercase">Aspects and Fate Points</h1>
				<p>An <b>aspect</b> is a word or phrase that describes something special about a person, place, thing, situation, or group. Almost anything you can think of can have aspects. A person might be the <b class="is-italic">Greatest Swordswoman on the Cloud Sea</b>. A room might be <b class="is-italic">On Fire</b> after you knock over an oil lamp. After a time-travel encounter with a dinosaur, you might be <b class="is-italic">Terrified</b>. Aspects let you change the story in ways that go along with your character’s tendencies, skills, or problems.</p>
				<p>You <b>spend fate points</b>—which you keep track of with pennies or glass beads or poker chips or some other tokens—to unlock the power of aspects and make them help you. You <b>earn</b> fate points by letting a character aspect be compelled against you to complicate the situation or make your life harder. Be sure to keep track of the fate points you have left at the end of the session—if you have <a href="#refresh">more than your refresh</a>, you start the next session with the fate points you ended this session with.</p>
				<p class="box is-italic">You earned a lot of fate points during your game session, ending the day with five fate points. Your refresh is 2, so you’ll start with five fate points the next time you play. But another player ends the same session with just one fate point. His refresh is 3, so he’ll begin the next session with 3 fate points, not just the one he had left over.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">What Kinds of Aspects Are There?</h2>
				<p>There’s an endless variety of aspects, but no matter what they’re called they all work pretty much the same way. The main difference is how long they stick around before going away.</p>
				<div class="box">
					<section class="mb-5">
						<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Character Aspects</p>
						<p>These aspects are on your character sheet, such as your high concept and trouble. They describe personality traits, important details about your past, relationships you have with others, important items or titles you possess, problems you’re dealing with or goals you’re working toward, or reputations and obligations you carry. These aspects only change under very unusual circumstances; most never will.</p>
						<p class="has-text-centered is-italic">Examples: Captain of the Skyship Nimbus; On the Run From the Knights of the Circle;Attention to Detail; I Must Protect My Brother</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-5">
						<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Situation Aspects</p>
						<p>These aspects describe the surroundings that the action is taking place in. This includes aspects you create or discover using the create an advantage action. A situation aspect usually vanishes at the end of the scene it was part of, or when someone takes some action that would change or get rid of it. Essentially, they last only as long as the situational element they represent lasts.</p>
						<p class="has-text-centered is-italic">Examples: On Fire; Bright Sunlight; Crowd of Angry People; Knocked to the Ground</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-5">
						<p>To get rid of a situation aspect, you can attempt an overcome action to eliminate it, provided you can think of a way your character could accomplish it—dump a bucket of water on the <b class="is-italic">Raging Fire</b>, use evasive maneuvers to escape the enemy fighter that’s <b class="is-italic">On Your Tail</b>. An opponent may use a Defend action to try to preserve the aspect, if they can describe how they do it.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-5">
						<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Consequences</p>
						<p>These aspects represent injuries or other lasting trauma that happen when you get hit by attacks. They go away slowly, as described in <i>Ouch! Damage, Stress, and Consequences</i>.</p>
						<p class="has-text-centered is-italic">Examples: Sprained Ankle; Fear of Spiders; Concussion; Debilitating Self-Doubt</p>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-5">
						<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Boosts</p>
						<p>A boost is a temporary aspect that you get to use once (see “<i>What Do You Do With Aspects?</i>” next), then it vanishes. Unused boosts vanish when the scene they were created in is over or when the advantage they represent no longer exists. These represent very brief and fleeting advantages you get in conflicts with others.</p>
						<p class="has-text-centered is-italic">Examples: In My Sights; Distracted; Unstable Footing; Rock in His Boot</p>

				</div>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">What Do You Do With Aspects?</h2>
				<p>There are three big things you can do with aspects: invoke aspects, compel aspects, and use aspects to establish facts.</p>
				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Invoking Aspects</h3>
				<p>You invoke an aspect to give yourself a bonus or make things a bit harder for your opponent. You can invoke any aspect that you a) know about, and b) can explain how you use it to your advantage—including aspects on other characters or on the situation. Normally, invoking an aspect costs you a fate point—hand one of your fate points to the GM. To invoke an aspect, you need to describe how that aspect helps you in your current situation.</p>
				<div class="columns is-8 is-vcentered">
					<div class="column is-three-fifths">
						<div class="box">
							<ul>
								<li>I attack the zombie with my sword. I know zombies are Sluggish, so that should help me.</li>
								<li>I really want to scare this guy. I’ve heard he’s Scared of Mice, so I’ll release a mouse in his bedroom.</li>
								<li>Now that the guard’s Distracted, I should be able to sneak right by him.</li>
								<li>This spell needs to be really powerful—I’m an Archwizard of the Ancient Order, and powerful spells are my bread and butter.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<div class="box has-background-grey-darker has-text-white">
							<p class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold is-uppercase">PVP</p>
							<p>The only time that fate point might not go to the GM is when you’re in conflict with another player. If you are, and you invoke one of that player’s character aspects to help you out against them, they will get the fate point instead of the GM once the scene is over.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>What does invoking the aspect get you? Choose one of the following effects:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Add a +2 bonus to your total. This costs a fate point.</li>
					<li>Reroll the dice. This option is best if you rolled really lousy (usually a −3 or −4 showing on the dice). This costs a fate point.</li>
					<li>Confront an opponent with the aspect. You use this option when your opponent is trying something and you think an existing aspect would make it harder for them. For instance, an alien thug wants to draw his blaster pistol, but he’s <b class="is-italic">Buried in Debris</b>; you spend a fate point to invoke that aspect, and now your opponent’s level of difficulty is increased by +2.</li>
					<li>Help an ally with the aspect. Use this option when a friend could use some help and you think an existing aspect would make it easier for them. You spend a fate point to invoke the aspect, and now your friend gets a +2 on their roll.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><i>Important</i>: You can only invoke any aspect once on a given dice roll; you can’t spend a stack of fate points on one aspect and get a huge bonus from it. However, you can invoke several different aspects on the same roll.</p>
				<p>If you’re invoking an aspect to add a bonus or reroll your dice, wait until <i>after</i> you’ve rolled to do it. No sense spending a fate point if you don’t need to!</p>
				<p><b>Free invocations:</b> Sometimes you can invoke an aspect for free, without paying a fate point. If you create or discover an aspect through the <b>create an advantage</b> action, the first invocation on it (by you or an ally) is free (if you succeeded with style, you get two freebies). If you cause a consequence through an attack, you or an ally can invoke it once for free. A <b>boost</b> is a special kind of aspect that grants one free invocation, then it vanishes.</p>
				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Compelling Aspects</h3>
				<p>If you’re in a situation where having or being around a certain aspect means your character’s life is more dramatic or complicated, anyone can compel the aspect. You can even compel it on yourself—that’s called a self-compel. Compels are the most common way for players to earn more fate points.</p>
				<p>There are two types of compels.</p>
				<div class="columns is-8">
					<div class="column is-three-fifths">
						<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Decision compels</p>
						<p>This sort of compel suggests the answer to a decision your character has to make. If your character is <b class="is-italic">Princess of Alaria</b>, for example, you may need to stay to lead the defense of the Royal Alarian Castle rather than fleeing to safety. Or if you have a <b class="is-italic">Defiant Streak a Mile Wide</b>, maybe you can’t help but mouth off to the Dean of Discipline when he questions you.</p>
						<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-size-5">Event compels</p>
						<p>Other times a compel reflects something happening that makes life more complicated for you. If you have <b class="is-italic">Strange Luck</b>, of course that spell you’re working on in class accidentally turns the dour Potions Master’s hair orange. If you <b class="is-italic">Owe Don Valdeon a Favor</b>, then Don Valdeon shows up and demands that you perform a service for him just when it’s least convenient.</p>
						<p>In any case, when an aspect is compelled against you, the person compelling it offers you a fate point and suggests that the aspect has a certain effect—that you’ll make a certain decision or that a particular event will occur. You can discuss it back and forth, proposing tweaks or changes to the suggested compel. After a moment or two, you need to decide whether to accept the compel. If you agree, you take the fate point and your character makes the suggested decision or the event happens. If you refuse, you must pay a fate point from your own supply. Yes, this means that if you don’t have any fate points, you can’t refuse a compel!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<div class="box has-background-grey-darker has-text-white">
							<p class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold is-uppercase">How many Fate points does the GM get?</p>
							<p>As GM, you don’t need to track fate points for each NPC, but that doesn’t mean you get an unlimited number. Start each scene with a pool of one fate point per PC that’s in the scene. Spend fate points from this pool to invoke aspects (and consequences) against the PCs. When it’s empty, you can’t invoke aspects against them.</p>
							<p>How can you increase the size of your pool? When a player compels one of an NPC’s aspects, add the fate point to your pool. If that compel ends the scene, or when an NPC gives in, instead add those fate points to your pool at the start of the next scene.</p>
							<p>Fate points you award for compels do NOT come from this pool. You never have to worry about running out of fate points to award for compels.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Establishing Facts</h3>
				<p>The final thing that aspects can do is <b>establish facts</b> in the game. You don’t have to spend any fate points, roll dice, or anything to make this happen—just by virtue of having the aspect <b class="is-italic">Ruddy Duck’s Pilot</b>, you’ve established that your character is a pilot and that you fly a plane named the Ruddy Duck. Having the aspect <b class="is-italic">Mortal Enemy:</b> The Red Ninjas establishes that the setting has an organization called the Red Ninjas and that they’re after you for some reason. If you take the aspect <b class="is-italic">Sorcerer of the Mysterious Circle</b>, you not only establish that there’s a group of sorcerers called the Mysterious Circle, but that <i>magic exists in the setting and that you can perform it</i>.</p>
				<p>When you establish facts of the setting this way, make sure you do it in cooperation with other players. If most people want to play in a setting without magic, you shouldn’t unilaterally bring magic into it through an aspect. Make sure that the facts you establish through your aspects make the game fun for everyone.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Composing Good Aspects</h2>
				<p>When you need to think of a good aspect (we’re mainly talking about character and situation aspects here), think about two things:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How the aspect might help you—when you’d invoke it.</li>
					<li>How it might hurt you—when it would be compelled against you.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="box">
					<p>For example:</p>
					<section class="mb-4">
						<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-italic is-size-5">I’ll Get You, von Stendahl!</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Invoke this when acting against von Stendahl to improve your chances.</li>
							<li>Get a fate point when your dislike for von Stendahl makes you do something foolish to try to get him.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section class="mb-4">
						<p class="has-text-weight-bold is-italic is-size-5">Hair Trigger Nerves</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Invoke this when being extra vigilant and careful would help you.</li>
							<li>Get a fate point when this causes you to be jumpy and be distracted by threats that aren’t really there.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</div>
				<p>Obviously, your trouble aspect is supposed to cause problems—and thereby make your character’s life more interesting and get you fate points—so it’s okay if that one’s a little more one-dimensional, but other character and situation aspects should be double-edged.</p>

	<!--Stunts-->
	<section class="section">
		<div class="container is-max-desktop">
			<div class="content">
				<h1 class="title is-size-1 is-uppercase">Stunts</h1>
				<p><b>Stunts</b> are tricks, maneuvers, or techniques your character has that change how an approach works for your character. Generally this means you get a bonus in certain situations, but sometimes it gives you some other ability or characteristic. A stunt can also reflect specialized, high-quality, or exotic equipment that your character has access to that gives them a frequent edge over other characters.</p>
				<p>There’s no definitive list of stunts that you pick from; much like aspects, everyone composes their own stunts. There are two basic templates to guide you in composing your stunts, so you do have something to work from.</p>
				<p>The first type of stunt gives you a +2 bonus when you use a certain approach in a certain situation. Use this template:</p>
				<p>Because I [<b>describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of gear, or are otherwise awesome</b>], I get a +2 when I [<b>pick one: Carefully, Cleverly, Flashily, Forcefully, Quickly, Sneakily</b>][<b>pick one: attack, defend, create advantages, overcome</b>] when [<b>describe a circumstance</b>].</p>
				<div class="box">
					<p>For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Because I <b>am a Smooth Talker</b>, I get a +2 when I <b>Sneakily create advantages</b> when <b>I’m in conversation with someone</b>.</li>
						<li>Because I <b>am a Lover of Puzzles</b>, I get a +2 when I <b>Cleverly overcome obstacles</b> when <b>I am presented with a puzzle, riddle, or similar conundrum</b>.</li>
						<li>Because I <b>am a World-Class Duelist</b>, I get a +2 when I <b>Flashily attack</b> when <b>engaged in a one-on-one swordfight</b>.</li>
						<li>Because I <b>have a Big Kite Shield</b>, I get a +2 when I <b>Forcefully defend</b> when <b>I use my shield in close combat</b>.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Sometimes, if the circumstance is especially restrictive, you can apply the stunt to both the create an advantage action <i>and</i> the overcome action.</p>
				<p>The second type of stunt lets you make something true, do something cool, or otherwise ignore the usual rules in some way. Use this template:</p>
				<p>Because I [<b>describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of gear, or are otherwise awesome</b>], once per game session I can [<b>describe something cool you can do</b>].</p>
				<div class="box">
					<p>For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Because I <b>am Well Connected</b>, once per game session I can <b>find a helpful ally in just the right place</b>.</li>
						<li>Because I <b>am Quick on the Draw</b>, once per game session I can <b>choose to go first in a physical conflict</b>.</li>
						<li>Because I <b>can Run Circles Around a Leopard</b>, once per game session I can <b>show up anywhere I want to, provided I could run there, no matter where I started</b>.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>These templates exist to give you an idea of how stunts should be constructed, but don’t feel constrained to follow them exactly if you have a good idea. If you’d like to read more about the construction of stunts, see <i>Skills and Stunts in Fate Core</i>.</p>

	<!--Getting Better at Doing Stuff: Character Advancement-->
	<section class="section">
		<div class="container is-max-desktop">
			<div class="content">
				<h1 class="title is-size-1 is-uppercase">Getting Better at Doing Stuff: Character Advancement</h1>
				<p>People change. Your skills sharpen as you practice them. Your life experiences accumulate and shape your personality. <i>Aventuras de Outro Mundo</i> reflects that with <b>character advancement</b>, which allows you to change your aspects, add or change stunts, and raise your approach bonuses. You do this when your character reaches a milestone.</p>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Milestones</h2>
				<p>Stories in TV shows, comic books, movies, and even video games usually continue from episode to episode, season to season. It took Frodo three big books to take the Ring to the fiery mountain. It took Aang three seasons to defeat the Fire Lord. You get the idea. <i>AAW</i> can tell those kinds of stories; you play many game sessions in a row using the same characters—this is often called a <b>campaign</b>—and the story builds on itself. But within these long stories, there are shorter story arcs, like single episodes of a TV show or single issues of a comic, where shorter stories are told and wrapped up. <i>AAW</i> can do that too, even within a longer campaign.</p>
				<p>In <i>AAW</i>, we call those wrap-ups <b>milestones</b>—whether they’re small ones for short stories, or really big ones at the end of many sessions of play. <i>AAW</i> recognizes three types of milestones, and each one allows you to change your character in certain ways.</p>
				<div class="box">
					<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Minor Milestones</h3>
					<p>A <b>minor milestone</b> usually occurs at the end of a session of play, or when one piece of a story has been resolved. Rather than making your character more powerful, this kind of milestone is more about changing your character, about adjusting in response to whatever’s going on in the story if you need to. Sometimes it won’t really make sense to take advantage of a minor milestone, but you always have the opportunity in case you need to.</p>
					<p>After a minor milestone, you can choose to do one (and only one) of the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Switch the ratings of any two approaches.</li>
						<li>Rename one aspect that isn’t your high concept.</li>
						<li>Exchange one stunt for a different stunt.</li>
						<li>Choose a new stunt (and adjust your refresh, if you already have three stunts).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Also, if you have a moderate consequence, check to see if it’s been around for two sessions. If so, you can clear it.</p>
					<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Significant Milestones</h3>
					<p>A <b>significant milestone</b> usually occurs at the end of a scenario or the conclusion of a big plot event (or, when in doubt, at the end of every two or three sessions). Unlike minor milestones, which are primarily about change, significant milestones are about learning new things—dealing with problems and challenges has made your character generally more capable at what they do.</p>
					<p>In addition to the benefit of a minor milestone, you also gain both of the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If you have a severe consequence that’s been around for at least two sessions, you can clear it.</li>
						<li>Raise the bonus of one approach by one.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Major Milestones</h3>
					<p><b>Major milestones</b> should only occur when something happens in the campaign that shakes it up a lot—the end of a big story arc, the final defeat of a main NPC villain, or any other large-scale change that reverberates around your game world.</p>
					<p>These milestones are about gaining more power. The challenges of yesterday simply aren’t sufficient to threaten these characters anymore, and the threats of tomorrow will need to be more adept, organized, and determined to stand against them.</p>
					<p>Achieving a major milestone confers the benefits of a significant milestone <i>and</i> a minor milestone. In addition, you may do <i>all</i> of the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Take an additional point of refresh, which you may immediately use to purchase a stunt if you wish.</li>
						<li>Rename your character’s high concept (optional).</li>
					</ul>

				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Help Build Campaigns</h2>
				<p>A <b>campaign</b> is a series of games you play with the same characters, where the story builds on what happened in earlier sessions.

							<p>Being a GM and running games can seem intimidating and difficult at first. It’s a skill that takes some practice to master, so don’t worry—you’ll get better the more you do it. If you’d like to read more about the art of GMing Fate, there are several chapters in the Fate Core rules that you should check out: Running the Game, Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios, and The Long Game are particularly helpful.

				</div>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Build Scenarios and Run Game Sessions</h2>
				<p>A <b>scenario</b> is one short story arc, the sort of thing you might see wrapped up in one or two episodes of an adventure television show, even if it’s a smaller part of a bigger story. Usually you can wrap up a scenario in one to three game sessions, assuming you play for three or four hours at a time. But what is a scenario, and how do you build one?</p>
				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Scenarios</h3>
				<p>A scenario needs two things: A bad guy with a goal, and a reason the PCs can’t ignore it.</p>
				<p><b>Bad guy with a goal:</b> You’ve probably figured this out already. The campaign’s main opposition, or one of his allies, is probably your bad guy.</p>
				<p><b>Something the PCs can’t ignore:</b> Now you have to give the PCs a reason to care. Make sure the bad guy’s goal is up in the PCs’ faces, where they need to do something about it or bad things will happen to them, or to people or things they value.</p>
				<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Running Game Sessions</h3>
				<p>Now that your bad guy is doing something the PCs will pay attention to, it’s time to start them off. Sometimes the best way to do that, especially for the first session of a new story arc, is to put them right in the action. Once the PCs know why they should care about what’s going on, you just get out of the way and let them take care of it.</p>
				<p>That said, there are a bunch of tasks the GM needs to perform to run the session:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Run scenes:</b> A session is made up of individual scenes. Decide where the scene begins, who’s there, and what’s going on. Decide when all the interesting things have played out and the scene’s over.</li>
					<li><b>Adjudicate the rules:</b> When some question comes up about how to apply the rules, you get final say.</li>
					<li><b>Set difficulties:</b> You decide how difficult tasks should be. </li>
					<li><b>Play the NPCs:</b> Each player controls their own character, but you control all the rest, including the bad guys.</li>
					<li><b>Keep things moving:</b> If the players don’t know what to do next, it’s your job to give them a nudge. Never let things get too bogged down in indecision or because they don’t have enough information—do something to shake things up.</li>
					<li><b>Make sure everyone has a chance to be awesome:</b> Your goal isn’t to defeat the players, but to challenge them. Make sure every PC gets a chance to be the star once in a while, from the big bad warrior to the little sneaky thief.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Setting Difficulty Levels</h2>
				<div class="columns is-8">
					<div class="column is-two-thirds">
						<p>When another character is opposing a PC, their rolls provide the opposition in a conflict, contest, or challenge. But if there’s no active opposition, you have to decide how hard the task is.</p>
						<p><b>Low difficulties</b> are best when you want to give the PCs a chance to show off and be awesome. <b>Difficulties near their approach ratings</b> are best when you want to provide tension but not overwhelm them. <b>High difficulties</b> are best when you want to emphasize how dire or unusual the circumstances are and make them pull out all the stops.</p>
						<h3 class="title is-size-4 is-uppercase">Rules of Thumb:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>If the task isn’t very tough at all, give it a Mediocre (+0)—or just tell the player they succeed without a roll.</li>
							<li>If you can think of at least one reason why the task is tough, pick Fair (+2).</li>
							<li>If the task is extremely difficult, pick Great (+4).</li>
							<li>If the task is impossibly difficult, go as high as you think makes sense. The PC will need to drop some fate points and get lots of help to succeed, but that’s fine.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<div class="box has-background-grey-darker has-text-white">
							<p class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold is-uppercase">OPTIONAL RULE: APPROACH-RELATED TARGET NUMBERS</p>
							<p>Sometimes being Careful makes things a lot easier; sometimes it just takes too long. The GM may wish to adjust the target number up or down by 1 or 2 depending on whether you choose a fitting or a problematic approach. This makes things a bit more complex, but for some groups it’s worth it.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2 class="title is-size-3 is-uppercase">Bad Guys</h2>
				<p>When you make a bad guy, you can stat them out exactly like the PCs, with approaches, aspects, stress, and consequences. You should do this for important or recurring bad guys who are intended to give the PCs some real difficulties, but you shouldn’t need more than one or two of these in a scenario.</p>
				<p><b>Mooks:</b> Other bad guys are <b>mooks</b>—unnamed thugs or monsters or goons that are there to make the PCs’ day a little more difficult, but they’re designed to be more or less easily swept aside, especially by powerful PCs. Here’s how you create their stats:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Make a list of what this mook is skilled at. They get a +2 to all rolls dealing with these things.</li>

					<li>Give the mook an aspect or two to reinforce what they’re good and bad at, or if they have a particular strength or vulnerability. It’s okay if a mook’s aspects are really simple.</li>
					<li>Mooks have zero, one, or two boxes in their stress track, depending on how tough you imagine them to be.</li>
					<li>Mooks can’t take consequences. If they run out of stress boxes (or don’t have any), the next hit takes them down.</li>

				<p><b>Groups of Mooks:</b> If you have a lot of low-level bad guys facing the PCs, you can make your job easier by treating them as a group—or maybe a few groups. Instead of tracking a dozen bad guys, you track three groups of four bad guys each. Each of these groups acts like a single character and has a set of stats just like a single mook would:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Choose a couple of things they’re skilled at. You might designate “ganging up” as one of the things the group is good at.</li>

				<p><i>Fate Core</i> has a way of handling this, called mobs (see the “<i>Creating the Opposition</i>” section of the <i>Running the Game</i> chapter in <i>Fate Core</i>). Feel free to use that option if you prefer. Note that it may lead to very strong mobs, unless you start with extremely weak mooks—if you want to give your PCs a serious challenge, that could be one way to do it.</p>
